`Hidden Lake Projects` are an offshoot of the development from the original project. The purpose of these projects is to create monolithic (most often console-based) applications without reference to services and microservice architecture in particular.

## List of projects

1. [hlp-chat](hlp-chat) - console messenger with group chats

## Advantages and disadvantages

The advantage of the projects over the original Hidden Lake development vector are: 1) one project = one application, which is easier to install and run, 2) it is easier to ensure the security of the local environment by entering passwords for authentication / data encryption.

The disadvantage of projects over the original Hidden Lake development vector are: 1) lack of development flexibility, 2) lack of flexibility in using only the necessary applications, 3) difficulty adapting to network communication platforms or protocols.
